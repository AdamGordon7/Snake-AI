# Snake-AI
Snake AI using Java and a provided api from wits
As the snake AI uses a jar file it will need to be installed into your IDE in order to run the snake agent 
As such i have attached a demo video of the snake agent in action
In the video I am the red snake.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The snake uses a BFS to find the shortest distace from itself to the apple
It then also calculates the Euclidean distance between the other snakes and the apple.
Only If my snake is the closest to the apple it will go and eat it.
If not my snake will chase its tail until it is the closest to the apple.
The blue apple(special apple) gives the snake the power of invisibility for 600 timesteps. If ther blue apple spawns on the board it will priortise that apple of the standard red apple

It also edxplains how to install the jar file if you wish to run my agent on your machine.
